1. what is data structure
--> collection of data values ---> [1,2,3,5,8] 
- releationships among them,-> index of each number
- functions operations that can be applied on---- const arr = [1,2,5,6] we can push the data...

2. why do you need to learn them to ace coding interviews? 
i/p ---> algorithm ---> o/p
- some DS's are more efficient than others to do some task
- it means some algorithms may take less time or less space..
